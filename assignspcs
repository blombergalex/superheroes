This assignment is to test your knowledge of base Node functionality, focusing on the default modules: http, url and fs.

Your task is to build a multiple page application with a server the delivers content based on the request/response protocol. The subject matter is entirely up to you, and no styling is required.

To achieve a Godkänt grade you must:

Create a webserver
Create a home page
Create content for at least 4 routes
At least two routes must render html
At least two routes must display content that comes from an external file (eg txt or html)

To achieve a Välgodkänt grade you must do the above and:
Read queries passed in the url
Generate different content based on the queries
The content should be stored in external files

The actual content, routes and queries are entirety up to you. For ease of assessment, I strongly recommend adding instructions on how to access your routes and queries to the home page. I need to know where I'm supposed to go!

Submission: gitub pages does NOT support Node, so submission will be a link to the repo. I will clone it and run it locally.
