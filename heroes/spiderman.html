        <h3>Facts About Spiderman</h3>
        <p>Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Spider-Man first appeared in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962. Peter Parker is a young, nerdy high school student who gains superhuman abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. As Spider-Man, Peter possesses incredible strength, agility, and reflexes, as well as the ability to cling to walls and sense danger with his "spider-sense." Initially using his powers for personal gain, Peter learns the hard way that "with great power comes great responsibility" and adopts the role of a crime-fighting superhero, patrolling the streets of New York City and battling villains such as the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom. Spider-Man is known for his iconic red and blue costume, web-shooters, and witty banter during combat. Despite facing numerous personal struggles and setbacks, including the death of loved ones and financial hardships, Spider-Man remains dedicated to using his powers for the greater good and protecting the innocent. Over the years, Spider-Man has become one of Marvel's most beloved and enduring characters, appearing in countless comic book storylines, as well as adaptations in film, television, and other media.</p>
