        <h3>Catwoman</h3>
        <p class="info-para">Catwoman, also known as Selina Kyle, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane, Catwoman made her first appearance in Batman #1 in 1940. Selina Kyle is a skilled burglar and master thief with a complex and morally ambiguous personality. Often depicted as an antiheroine or sometimes antagonist, Catwoman operates in Gotham City, where she frequently crosses paths with Batman, with whom she shares a complicated romantic relationship. Catwoman is known for her agility, acrobatic skills, and proficiency in hand-to-hand combat, making her a formidable opponent for both heroes and villains alike. She is often portrayed as a cat burglar with a love for stealing valuable jewels and artifacts, as well as a strong sense of independence and self-reliance. Despite her criminal activities, Catwoman has a strong moral code and often shows compassion for the less fortunate, leading her to occasionally ally herself with Batman to fight against common threats. Over the years, Catwoman has become one of Batman's most enduring and iconic adversaries, as well as a complex and multifaceted character in her own right. She has been featured in numerous comic book storylines, as well as adaptations in film, television, and other media.</p>
