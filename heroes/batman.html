        <h3>Facts About Batman</h3>
        <p>Batman, also known as the Dark Knight, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, Batman first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in 1939. His alter ego is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire industrialist and philanthropist who, after witnessing the murder of his parents as a child, dedicates his life to fighting crime in the fictional Gotham City. Unlike many superheroes, Batman possesses no superhuman powers; instead, he relies on his intellect, detective skills, martial arts prowess, and a vast array of gadgets and technology to combat the criminals and super villains that plague his city. Batman is often depicted as a brooding and complex character, driven by a sense of justice and a desire to prevent others from suffering the same fate he did. He operates from his secret headquarters, the Batcave, beneath Wayne Manor, and is assisted by allies like his loyal butler Alfred Pennyworth and his sidekick Robin. Over the years, Batman has become one of the most iconic and enduring characters in comic book history, inspiring numerous adaptations in film, television, and other media..</p>
